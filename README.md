# üè∫Interactive 3D Renderer

An interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. The repository contains all of the code for this project, including branches of different use cases.

Heavily guided by [Brendan Galea](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR)'s series.

Visual Studio 2022 is recommended to view and run the code.

A proper build script using CMake will be created at a later date, once the project is complete.
